Title:	GeneticAlgorithmExample

This program is an example of genetic programming that optimizes the coefficients for a fictional reflow oven PID controller. Contained is the source code to generate the coefficients, along with an excel sheet where you can plug these coefficients in to test how the reflow oven would react using them. In the future, it would be nice to display the graph generated by excel in a Swing applet.

This program uses the Watchmaker framework, http://watchmaker.uncommons.org/
